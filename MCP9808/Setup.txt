This is outlining the instructions to connect the i2c mcp9808 thermometer from a red board to the STM32 L4R5ZI.

ON THE BREADBOARD:

Connect pins to the Vdd, GNnd, SCL, and SDA.

ON THE STM32 BOARD:

** there are multiple combinations that could work as we are just connecting lines, however, the one listed below is ONE POSSIBLE and USABLE combination **

** Look at data sheet for thermometer on Google Drive **

USING the CN8 Pins:

    VDD goes into either 3V3 or 5V pin

    GND goes into any GND pin, such as the one below 5V

    SCL goes into the middle I2C pins (near the bottom left CN8 column, there are 3 pins dedicated for I2C) (Pin PF1 on the STM32 board)

    SDA goes into  the last I2C pin (underneath SCL) (PIN PF0 on the STM32 board)

In the STM32 IDE:
    ** This only applies to the SCL and SDA lines, thus, if you used differnt pins for VDD and/or GND, this wont effect anything below
    however, if you used different SCL and/or SDA pins than the ones listed above, then you will need to go to the STM32 pinout document 
    to find which pinout correlates correctly to the one you used **

        Go to the PF0 pinout and select the option: "I2C2_SDA"

        Go to the PF1 pinout and select the option: "I2C2_SCL"
