Seems like opening a file for testing would be a lot more work than it's worth but can be explored later.
For now I'm going to use UART3 for RX/TX with the laptop,
and UART2 for RX/TX with the camera. 
This should allow me to communicate with both devices and print the 'picture' as it's given by the camera.
